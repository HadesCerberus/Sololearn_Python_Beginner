#Input

#Right, so we know that the input() function returns a string. But what if we need it to be something else, like a number? 
#No problem, we can totally do that!
#Let's assume we’ve taken the age of the user as an input.
#To convert it to a number, we can use the int() function:

age = int(input())
print(age)  

#This will turn it from a string to an integer. Simple, right?

#But wait, there’s more! We can do the same thing in reverse, and convert a number to a string, but this time we need to use the...
#you guessed it, the str() function. This can be useful if you need to use a number in string concatenation.

#For example:

age = 42
print("His age is " + str(age))  


#You can convert to float using the float() function.

Input
What will be the output of this code?

x = “2”
y = “4”
z = int(x) + int(y)
print(z)

#OUTPUT
6

#*************************************************************************

Input
#The last thing to mention is that you can use input() multiple times to take multiple user inputs.
#For example:

name = input()
age = input()

print(name + " is " + age)   


#When the input() function executes the program flow stops until a user enters some value. Ball’s in your court user!
