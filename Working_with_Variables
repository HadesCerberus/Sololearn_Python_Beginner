#Working with Variables


#So, you’ve got your variable, and named it. You’re now free to use them to perform corresponding operations, 
#just as you do with numbers and strings. Like this:

x = 7
print(x)

print(x + 3)
print(x)

#You can see that the variable stores its value throughout the program.


#Need to change the value of a variable? Easy. Variables can be reassigned as many times as you want. Like this:

x = 123.456
print(x)

x = "This is a string"
print(x + "!")

#But Beware! Overwriting the same variable with different data types is not good practice. To avoid mistakes, try to avoid doing it.
