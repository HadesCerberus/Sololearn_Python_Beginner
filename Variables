#Variables


#A variable lets you store a value by assigning it to a name. The name can be used to refer to the value later in the program.
#For example, in game development, you would use a variable to store the points of the player. What’s the point of playing if 
#you don’t know who’s winning right!
#To assign a variable, use one equals sign

user = "James"  

#In the example above we assigned string "James" to a variable called user.

#other example:
#Fill in the blanks to create a variable "age" and assign the value 42 to it:
age = 42

#Variable Names
#Naming your variables is pretty flexible. You can use letters, numbers, and underscores in variable names. 
#But you can’t use special symbols, or start the name with a number.
#Don’t forget, Python is a case sensitive language. Which means, Lastname and lastname are two different variable names.
