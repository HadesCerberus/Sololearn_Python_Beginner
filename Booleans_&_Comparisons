#Booleans
***************************

#You’re making great progress! Well done! You’re definitely ready to meet another type in Python.
#So we’ve met strings, integers and floats. Let’s add Booleans into the mix shall we?
#Booleans can have two values: True and False.
#We can create them by comparing values, for instance by using the equal operator ==. Like this:

my_boolean = True
print(my_boolean)
True

print(2 == 3)
False

print("hello" == "hello")
True

#OUTPUT
True
False
True

#Be careful not to confuse assignment (one equals sign) with comparison (two equals signs). But don’t worry, we’ll be talking more about this later.

*************************************
#Comparison
*************************************

It’s not just the equal operator (==) that creates Booleans though, oh no! You can use any of the comparison operators (and there are a few) to compare values and create a Boolean.

So what are the other comparison operators? Well, we’ve got: equal to ==, not equal to !=, greater than >, smaller than <, greater or equal to >=, smaller or equal to <=.

Now that might seem like a lot to take in, so let’s look at some examples:


x = 7

print(x != 8)
print(x > 5)
print(x < 2)
print(x >= 7)
print(x <= 7)

#OUTPUT
True
True
False
True
True





Comparison operators are also called Relational operators.
