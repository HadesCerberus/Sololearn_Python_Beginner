#Input


#What function would we use to get input from the user in Python? Drumroll please! That’s right, the input function! 
#Python likes to keep things simple and intuitive.

#So a game can ask for the user's name and age as input and then use them in the game.

#The input function prompts the user for input, and returns what they enter as a string. Like this:
#Even if the user enters a number as input, it’s processed as a string.

x = input()
print(x)

#other example

text = input()
print(text)


#********************************************************************************************************************
#To make the input statement work, it needs to be followed by parentheses. 
#You should recognize this principle from the print statements we covered in module 1.

#You can then provide a string to input() between the parentheses, producing a prompt message.

name = input("Enter your name: ")

print("Hello, " + name) 

#OUTPUT
#Hello Lisa


#For example:
#The prompt message tells the user what input the program is asking for – so it’s important that it’s clear.
