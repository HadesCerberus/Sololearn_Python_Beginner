#Even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers.

*****************
#Adding a string to a number produces an error, 
as even though they might look similar, 
they are two different entities.
*****************


Strings can also be multiplied by integers. 
This produces a repeated version of the original string. 
The order of the string and the integer doesn't matter, but the string usually comes first.

print("spam" * 3)
output
spamspamspam

print(4 * '2')
output
2222
